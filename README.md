Classroom-ready open-source educational exoskeleton for biomedical and control engineering

The classroom Exo development is guided by the manual.
The manual is designed to assist you in seamlessly transitioning from EduExoPro to Classroom Exo. Whether you're a developer, educator, or enthusiast, the detailed content in each folder aims to provide clarity and guidance.

How to Use This Manual:
Begin by reading through the manual to familiarize yourself with the upgrade process.
Depending on your area of interest or expertise, navigate to the specific folders that match your requirementsâ€”whether it's CAD, PCB design, electronics, or material lists.
Feel free to collaborate by providing feedback, raising issues, or contributing to the ongoing development of Classroom Exo. Your input is highly valued.

We prepared three lab instructions for a) Force Control, b) Muscle Activity Control, and c) PID Control for Biomedical and Control Engineering University Education. Feel free to use these documents to build your own lab for a physical human-machine interaction, health robotics, and for all control theory courses.

We hope this manual serves as a valuable resource in your journey to implement Classroom Exo. 
Happy exploring and building with Classroom Exo!
